# HeGeL: A Novel Dataset for Hebrew Geo-Location

This repository contains data and code for the HeGeL paper which was published in ACL2023 Findings - https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.460/

## Data

The data can be found here - https://github.com/tzuf/HeGeL/tree/main/data/human.

The data contains three json files corresponding to three split-sets: train (Tel Aviv), dev (Haifa), and test (Jerusalem).

Each sample contains the following:

* content - place description.
* geometry - the wkt shape of the geolocation of the place.
* goal_point - the centroid of the geometry.


## Model

### Dependencies

* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) - Machine learning library for Python-related dependencies
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) - Anaconda includes all the other Python-related dependencies
